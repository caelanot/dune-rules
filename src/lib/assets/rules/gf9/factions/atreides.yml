            During the Battle Phase, you may force your 
            opponent to reveal your choice of one of the four 
            elements they will use in their Battle Plan against you:
            the leader, the weapon, the defense, or the number 
            dialed. If you choose to ask about a weapon or defense 
            and your opponent tells you that they are not playing 
            that element during this battle, you may not then ask to 
            see a different element.

            The Kwisatz Haderach starts out inactive and
            the Kwisatz Haderach token may not be used.
            Use the Kwisatz Haderach card and counter token
            to secretly keep track of forces lost in battle.
            Once you have lost 7 or more forces in battles,
            the Kwisatz Haderach token becomes active for
            the rest of the game.
