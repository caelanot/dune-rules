    Each faction has a set of unique economic, military,
    strategic, or treacherous advantages. The object of the
    game is to use these advantages to gain control of Dune.
    The winner is the _First Player_ to occupy at least 3
    strongholds with at least one of their forces during
    the Mentat Pause Phase.

    A player may win alone or in an Alliance with other players.
